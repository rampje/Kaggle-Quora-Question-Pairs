```{r}
# Load packages and read the training data into R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
train <- read.csv("train.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
```

```{r}
glimpse(train)
```

```{r}
# Take a look at the questions
head(train[c("question1","question2")])
```

```{r}
# Proportion of data that is duplicates vs not
table(train$is_duplicate) / nrow(train)
```

Get a histogram of question length differences:
```{r}
train$charDiff <- nchar(train$question1) - nchar(train$question2)

h <- ggplot(data=train, aes(x=charDiff))
h + geom_histogram(aes(fill = as.character(train$is_duplicate)))
```

```{r}
plotStage <- train %>% filter(charDiff > -200 & charDiff < 200)
h <- ggplot(data=plotStage, aes(x=charDiff))
h + geom_histogram(aes(fill = as.character(plotStage$is_duplicate)))
```
